Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.</p><p>When written in Chinese, the word 'crisis' is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.</p><p>INFO</p><input type="button" id="button1" value= "Get Info" onclick="getInfo()"><input type="button" id="button2" value= "Remove First" onclick="removeParagraph(0)"><input type="button" id="button3" value= "Remove Second" onclick="removeParagraph(1)"><input type="button" id="button4" value= "Remove Third" onclick="removeParagraph(2)"><input type="button" id="button5" value= "Highlight first" onclick="highlightParagraph(0)"><input type="button" id="button6" value= "Highlight second" onclick="highlightParagraph(1)"></body></html>
